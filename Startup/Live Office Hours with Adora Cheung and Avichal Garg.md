**8 speakers** (Speaker 1, Adora Cheung, Avichal Garg, Angela, Female , Sid, Zack, Speaker 9)

*[0:00:12]*
**Speaker 1**: Hey everyone. For today's Live Office Hours we're joined by Adora and Avichal, and I'll leave it to them to introduce themselves.

*[0:00:22]*
**Adora Cheung**: I'm Adora Cheung. I am a partner at Y Combinator. Previously, I was the founder/CEO of a startup called Homejoy.

*[0:00:29]*
**Avichal Garg**: Hey, Avichal Garg, I'm a YC expert. I was most recently director of product at Facebook. I've done a couple startups, sold a couple, invested in a bunch.

*[0:00:45]*
**Angela**: Angela.

*[0:00:45]*
**Adora Cheung**: Hello, Adora, nice to meet you.

*[0:00:46]*
**Avichal Garg**: Avichal, good to meet you.

*[0:00:50]*
**Adora Cheung**: Cool, welcome. So, tell us what you do.

*[0:00:52]*
**Angela**: Hi, we're working on Appmission. It's a web application that offers high quality, personalized college admission advice for high school students.

*[0:01:00]*
**Adora Cheung**: So, is there another person on the other end, or how does the ... Can you give the most common use case of how people use it?

*[0:01:06]*
**Angela**: So, a student can sign up for free, and then they will create a profile. The profile includes the academic information, including the GPA, test scores, and also extracurricular activities, and the college goals. For example, the colleges that they want to get into and also the majors they are interested in. So, once they enter the data, we use our algorithm to generate a personalized recommendation to them to help them reach their goals.

*[0:01:32]*
**Avichal Garg**: Gotcha. So, who's using this or who do you want to use this?

*[0:01:34]*
**Angela**: The high school students and their parents.

*[0:01:36]*
**Avichal Garg**: Who, more specifically?

*[0:01:38]*
**Angela**: For those who cannot afford private college counseling, because the price range is from $4,000 to $40,000 per package.

*[0:01:47]*
**Avichal Garg**: I see. And why would they use this?

*[0:01:52]*
**Angela**: Because in the U.S. Public high school, one counselor serves 491 students, and each student only gets 38 minutes of college advising per year, so we want to fill in the gap so they can get access and we think that every student deserves the help they need to get into college.

*[0:02:08]*
**Adora Cheung**: Is there one particular thing that they really need help on? Because one of the things I think a lot of people only buy a lot of books about is essays, because the application itself is pretty objective and standard, right? So, do you find there's a specific feature that people are really looking for and will actually pay for?

*[0:02:24]*
**Angela**: Yeah, that's interesting. When we first started, we kind of just came pretty broad. We talked about our essays, we talked about college selections. But recently, when we talked to some of the users, we found out that they want one-on-one interactions, and specifically on college selection and the essay.

*[0:02:44]*
**Adora Cheung**: So are you building a marketplace then, of people?

*[0:02:48]*
**Angela**: So when we first started, we just kind of did it on our own, like the backend is us. But actually, we talked to Anton, our mentor on this at our school, and we also got some feedback from users saying they want one-on-one interactions. So, last weekend, our team spent 30 hours to build and launch that marketplace.

*[0:03:09]*
**Adora Cheung**: And how's that going?

*[0:03:11]*
**Angela**: It's going quicker than I expected. So we, for the past three days we had about 800 people visit the site, and then we had about 60 advisors signed up. So right now, because of the marketplace, we focus on the supply side first.

*[0:03:31]*
**Adora Cheung**: Okay, so you have 60 advisors, and so you're focused on acquiring those. Do you think that's enough? It seems like enough because it's a ... Excuse me?

*[0:03:41]*
**Female **: I don't think they can hear you.

*[0:03:43]*
**Adora Cheung**: Can you hear me?

*[0:03:44]*
**Avichal Garg**: Hear me and Adora or these guys?

*[0:03:44]*
**Adora Cheung**: Oh, there we go. Or is this not on?

*[0:03:44]*
**Female **: Can everybody hear in the back?

*[0:03:52]*
**Adora Cheung**: Are we doing okay? I can yell also. Does this make it better?

*[0:04:01]*
**Avichal Garg**: It may not have been on before. Is that better?

*[0:04:04]*
**Adora Cheung**: Are we good? Are we good? Okay, cool.

*[0:04:06]*
**Avichal Garg**: In back?

*[0:04:06]*
**Adora Cheung**: Sorry about that. So supply side acquisition. So you got 60 advisors, it looks like you're ready to go then, right?

*[0:04:13]*
**Angela**: Yeah, we're ready to go but then we right now our next step is to review those advisors and make sure that their profile is nice and that they are high quality of counselors who have specialized certain areas so that we can use those to attract the students.

*[0:04:28]*
**Avichal Garg**: Why is now the right time to do this? This could have been done five years ago, has something changed in the world that makes this possible now?

*[0:04:36]*
**Angela**: I think that at our industry has been grown slower than other consumer-based technology, so I think right now is a good time because the parents and student they are getting more and more tools in their school using technology to learn, like personalized learning and collaborative learning, so I think this is the space where it has not been fully utilized yet.

*[0:04:59]*
**Avichal Garg**: Why do you think that is?

*[0:05:02]*
**Angela**: I think the reason why is people usually they focus really on tutoring, they've put a lot of those energy on to getting good grades. And then they feel like they know exactly how they can get into college just based on their friends and family. So they rely a lot of those personal advice from their friends and family or whoever have gone through that, but we want to give them the professional side of thing.

*[0:05:31]*
**Adora Cheung**: It seems like the amount of information out there is out there and so people are probably trying to differentiate themselves because there's the internet and I can get that same access as person A or person B, right? And so it makes sense that you need somebody else to tell you how to make it better versus just reading stuff. So I wanted to focus on, it seems like your biggest challenge right now is going to be matching, right? So you have 60 advisors, do you believe they're ... It sounds like you believe that they're high quality enough right now to start matching them?

*[0:06:05]*
**Female **: Some of them not all of them.

*[0:06:07]*
**Adora Cheung**: So how are you going to, or what are your top two, three determinants of bringing on these advisors in?

*[0:06:13]*
**Female **: So definitely one of the things that we are looking for is whether the counselor or the advisor is certified or licensed. Again, we just launched more occupations a few days ago, what we are going to do is to focus on those profiles that are existing right now and talk to the actual advisors to see if they have the credential.

*[0:06:31]*
**Adora Cheung**: Are you advisors yourselves?

*[0:06:34]*
**Angela**: I am.

*[0:06:35]*
**Female **: Yeah, Angela is.

*[0:06:35]*
**Adora Cheung**: So you're on the site?

*[0:06:36]*
**Angela**: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

*[0:06:36]*
**Adora Cheung**: Okay, and have you why don't, I mean one thing would be just to match people to you and to figure that piece of-

*[0:06:41]*
**Angela**: Right, so when I start doing that I had one person, which I met in person because they basically meet with me in person that's how we got ... We think that that is something that would be valuable, but we already stop putting myself out there into ... On the supply side.

*[0:07:00]*
**Avichal Garg**: So, there's a whole set of product risk here, which I think you guys have worked through. The thing I keep coming back to is actually the market risk on this one. So my first start up was in education so I know a ton about this space actually. Historically, the challenge has been that the way that the average person in the US thinks about things like college admissions is actually pretty different than the way that people who are in this room probably think about college education. And fundamentally a lot of that comes down to do you think about education as an investment or an expenditure. This happens in a lot of markets where you kind of build for yourself and then you realize the market doesn't actually behave the way that you behave and so there's a leap that sometimes companies aren't able to make. That's why I was sort of probing on that is like has the market actually underneath has changed. Have you actually validated that people want the same thing that you want and that that market is large enough to actually support a business.

*[0:07:50]*
**Angela**: Well actually there's recent change that I think would give us the opportunity, which is the new administration. Because we're talking about funding cut into public school system so we were expect that the resources that they have will be less and less, and I think that is an opportunity to educate the parents and student and it should promote the needs of having college advising.

*[0:08:13]*
**Avichal Garg**: Gotcha, but they don't currently get it today?

*[0:08:16]*
**Angela**: Right, they get very minimal.

*[0:08:18]*
**Adora Cheung**: What resources do people have 'cause there's books, there used to be sites like vault.com, which I don't think gives advice anymore, so what are they using right now?

*[0:08:30]*
**Angela**: Right, so there are a lot of free sites out there like College Board, they have check, they have different web sites that tells them the details of the colleges that probably the application rates and all those stuff, but those are not personalized for them. When we did an interview with the users, they found it very overwhelming to go through all these different site.

*[0:08:50]*
**Avichal Garg**: Who were the people that you were interviewing? Where did you find those?

*[0:08:53]*
**Angela**: We found it from our neighborhood, found it from our friends' kids and basically people that we know.

*[0:09:00]*
**Avichal Garg**: Right, I keep coming back to this. I think specifically this is one of the biggest risks in the education market is that the mass market is going to behave differently than the people that you know. So actually validating by talking to those people what their needs are and what you want to build for those people and what they want is actually pretty critical early one because people from your neighborhood probably think about education very similarly to the way you do. Or your friends' kids probably think about education very similarly to the way-

*[0:09:24]*
**Angela**: That's why ever since we launched we try to iterate different ideas under the site to see which one catch more of the attention. So far I think we were able to identify that one on one personalized interaction is important, but I think the next step we want to drill down into something more specific so that we can just focus on that one thing.

*[0:09:46]*
**Avichal Garg**: Have you guys considered the international markets at all? Is this just a US problem or is this like a global problem?

*[0:09:54]*
**Female **: We thought about it, there's some leads that we talked to. There's definitely the potential there for international markets but the platform that we have been on so far is really targeted to US. But that doesn't really limit us on expanding to more markets.

*[0:10:10]*
**Avichal Garg**: Yeah, have you thought about going international first? As opposed to US first?

*[0:10:14]*
**Female **: Our target was basically states first, that was the focus and in fact our website is admission.us so is more like a ... But definitely again we do know that there are people out there outside of United States who want to study here in the States and they need that information as well. We talk to advisors as well from outside of the country and there's the need but we don't really have any like, let's target those market, yet.

*[0:10:44]*
**Adora Cheung**: How many users are on your site right now?

*[0:10:47]*
**Angela**: We have about 200 students.

*[0:10:50]*
**Adora Cheung**: 200 students and where are they, what's the common element among all of them?

*[0:10:54]*
**Angela**: So we have 40% of those are seniors so that tells me that they are pretty, they wait until pretty last minute to do this and then there are 25% the junior and majority of them are focusing on computer science and engineering math type and business majors.

*[0:11:12]*
**Adora Cheung**: It sounds like you might want to, I know this is kind of what I think Avichal is getting at also, is trying to figure out what is that core thing that they really need versus this like, right now it seems a little abstract of I'm going to help you find a college but it might be something as simple as the essay, like I need help on the essay and just focus on that one thing and drive it home versus being a little bit, doing so many things at once.

*[0:11:40]*
**Female **: Yeah, so admission submission is to make sure that we provide the same opportunity for all students, that chance to go into college. We understand that definitely within maybe California, maybe in bigger cities that people, students are more educated, more they have the background of what's the path to college and beyond that what we are trying to do again going back to mission we want to make sure that outside of these group of students people from outside of California also have the same access to the same information. If you think about ... Or actually based on our survey or talking to users, we know that a lot of students actually think they might not even have the chance to go into colleges because it might not be affordable to them. But there's definitely alternatives for them like financial aid and things like that. That's the tier that we're trying to target to make sure that they have access to the information so that they know they at least have the chance to apply to college or maybe qualify for financial aid and path.

*[0:12:52]*
**Avichal Garg**: I'm just going to echo what Adora is saying, I love what you just said by the way, that's an awesome mission. When you think about a company and there's like the mission, there's the vision it's like, "When we achieve the mission here's what the world will look like." There's the strategy, which is like, here's in the fewest number of words how we're going to go about achieving our mission and then there's the tactics, there's the things that you do week over week in pursuit of your strategy to validate whether that strategy is true or not. I think the advice that Adora is giving is more like strategic advice where it's like okay great, that's an awesome mission but where do you start? Or what is the first value that you create for people and then that lets you create that second value, and that third value and then you've created all of the value for that population of people, but where do you start.

*[0:13:26]*
**Adora Cheung**: Yeah if you think about if you're going to apply to college there's many steps in that, and you can't tackle every single step so find the one in which people are having the most issue with, or they need the most help in which they will actually pay for as well because you're trying to obviously build a business, right?

*[0:13:40]*
**Avichal Garg**: And it's not just, sorry to cut you off, but it's not just project strategy, there's also the go to market strategy which is like, that's a lot of people right, what is it, how many people, is it like 50% of people even take the SAT in the US? It's like half the people don't even take the SAT. So you're talking about large numbers of people at every step of the funnel and so who you target is also part of your strategy and who you target is going to be directly tied to what you build for those people as a first step.

*[0:14:03]*
**Angela**: Yeah I think that's a great point and when we first started there were like many different angles we could target and we want to use that they users data and the ... We wanted to just ask the users to drive us to which is the focus. I felt like because the early acquisition is really hard for the users so I don't have enough people to actually give me feedback on which areas they want to focus on. Some early indication is school selection and essay, so these are the two that so far I can identify from major is like science, math, and business so those are three majors. We have some pieces though, signals that tell us which way we should go but I know in my hear that going forward there is some one area that I need to focus on I feel like we don't have enough data to get there yet.

*[0:14:49]*
**Avichal Garg**: Yeah well the challenge with data is, this goes back to there's basically two ways to figure out what you want to build whether it's your market, your go to market plan your product is the top down which is like you go get a bunch of data, where are the opportunities, how do you slice the market, we're going to start here then we're going to go here and we're going to go here. Or bottoms up which is you build the thing, you put it out there, people start using it, they're like, "Oh we want this." We move forward. A lot of software actually bottoms up is great because the early adopters indicate where the world is headed. You build for them and then the rest of the world kind of catches up. Social networking was obviously was a great example of that. The challenge is if people that are the early adopters of your product are not representative of what everybody else is going to do then you end up building a thing that doesn't actually work for everybody else and that's I think part of the challenge that you would have right now if you do that. I suspect the people that are coming to you are not going to be 100% representative of, like to me it sounds like two different populations of people that you're talking about. The people who don't know about financial aid, or maybe are not applying to colleges, or not doing all this kind of stuff or don't have the support. Versus people who are organically finding this and care about this stuff a lot to me actually sound like different populations of people.

*[0:15:55]*
**Adora Cheung**: I think we have to finish up but just one last thing, it seems like a lot of people are coming to you for advice anyway and I might just start from there and just sit down with all these people and just do it all day every single day for the next I don't know few weeks and then see if they're anything common things that people are asking you. Also you have access to now 60 advisors, you could also sit with them and do the exact same thing. It's totally not a scalable thing to do in the future but it seems like to figure out where to start, that's like one way to go about doing it.

*[0:16:29]*
**Angela**: Thank you.

*[0:16:29]*
**Female **: Makes sense.

*[0:16:33]*
**Sid**: Hi I'm Sid.

*[0:16:40]*
**Avichal Garg**: Sid, Avichal.

*[0:16:40]*
**Adora Cheung**: Hey, Adora.

*[0:16:41]*
**Zack**: Hi I'm Zack.

*[0:16:42]*
**Adora Cheung**: Adora.

*[0:16:42]*
**Avichal Garg**: Avichal, good to meet yeah.

*[0:16:45]*
**Adora Cheung**: Cool, thanks for coming. What are you working on?

*[0:16:48]*
**Sid**: So I'm Sid and I'm the CEO and confounder of Jambo. At Jambo we are bringing computer vision and technology to solve the price and cost estimation problem for the home services market specifically we starting with the moving industry so let's say you are a consumer and you want to move you want to know how much it's going to cost you take a video and our technology will identify all the items and then you get a front an accurate code. This is much better than calling multiple moving companies, staying on the phone for about half an hour each to get arbitrary wrong quotes or waiting at home for an onsite estimator to come visit.

*[0:17:24]*
**Adora Cheung**: So is this an app?

*[0:17:27]*
**Zack**: Sure. We have multiple channels, we did an MVP pilot with an app. We've also been working on just having it directly on the webpage of the moving-

*[0:17:35]*
**Adora Cheung**: So say I'm at home, it sounds like I take the app and I'm taking pictures and I'm sending it to you guys and then you kind of give me an estimate ASAP essentially. Okay.

*[0:17:45]*
**Zack**: Correct. We also have a solution where you can text it to a number, but it's the same technology-

*[0:17:50]*
**Adora Cheung**: This is more accurate than the, or how what's the percent of accuracy do you get base on, versus someone coming in.

*[0:17:56]*
**Sid**: So we are targeting the same accuracy so the way we are thinking about it is today the estimation process takes about a week for you to get a quote or you get multiple quotes and you don't really understand why a quote is what it is. Our goal is to give you a complete breakdown on what it is, and we still have some human labor in the background cleaning up the mistakes the AI is making so our goal is to reduce the human time to less than five minutes.

*[0:18:25]*
**Avichal Garg**: Why is it so expensive, or why is it so, take a week to get a quote? Where are moving tech companies taking so long?

*[0:18:31]*
**Sid**: So one main reason is if you are scheduling an onsite estimator visit, so it cost a moving company a lot more than $200 per visit and you have to schedule something, schedule someone to come visit. These guys are able to do two to three estimates a day so in summer time when it's busy it gets really backed up. Most companies don't end up actually sending an onsite estimator and they give price quotes over the phone, our research shows that 90% of this is wrong so consumers shop around. They don't really understand why a company's quoting what they're quoting. And in a lot of cases what happens is there are these predatory providers in the market who take advantage of this price of weakness and they give you a low ball quote, get your business and on the day of you most specifically they slap you with last minute fee hikes.

*[0:19:22]*
**Avichal Garg**: I see.

*[0:19:23]*
**Sid**: So we want to bring, we want to eliminate all of that.

*[0:19:26]*
**Adora Cheung**: So once you get the quote are you also doing the moving yourself or are you selling leads?

*[0:19:32]*
**Zack**: Our strategy is we're working with moving companies to do the estimating for them so we are not a moving company and our customer is the moving company.

*[0:19:40]*
**Adora Cheung**: Ah, so you're the white label solution for them.

*[0:19:42]*
**Zack**: Correct, yes.

*[0:19:43]*
**Avichal Garg**: Why do you need computer vision for this? It seems like everything you described to me sounds like process failures, transparency, you know market place failures, it sounds like a bunch of, what does the computer vision give you?

*[0:19:53]*
**Sid**: So our initial MVP that we deployed doesn't have any computer vision, people just take videos and somebody watches it in the backend and to give a quote that takes around 19 minutes per person and also you need to hire and scale human work force to do that and there are a few other companies that's doing this. Our goal is we eliminate like majority of the work through using CV and keep the human workload to as less as possible. From a product perspective what we want to be also able to deliver to consumers is an interactive of them customizing their quote so let's say you have a a $2,000 budget and moving everything is maybe going to cost $3,000 then you can decide we can choose however you want to spend that money.

*[0:20:43]*
**Adora Cheung**: How do you intend to charge for this, and do you have current customers right now?

*[0:20:47]*
**Sid**: Yeah so we signed our first LOI for a paid trial with a moving company in San Diego where we are doing this GPM solution where it's $10 with no AI and $50 with AI. We are talking to multiple large moving companies from 20 million dollars annual revenue to a few billion dollars and we are in the final stages of negotiations with some of them. On the timeline that's a less of the features a paid pilot so it's like enterprise level contracts that we're going after.

*[0:21:22]*
**Adora Cheung**: So what is success look like for you, is it accuracy or what are these folks looking from you?

*[0:21:30]*
**Sid**: Two different things, from a consumer standpoint they want to reduce the friction of, they want to provide a better quality of service because there's no way for the good companies to differentiate themselves right now so they are looking at it as a better way to do customer service and also from a cost standpoint since it costs more than $200 to send an onsite estimator and it doesn't scale they are looking at ways to increase their bottom line in their profits.

*[0:21:58]*
**Adora Cheung**: I wonder if there's a bigger market in you being the initial, like people thinking you're the initial moving company or and you're selling the leads. I don't know if you want to get into the actual moving itself, that seems quite different it's just operationally a headache but instead part of what you're doing is also acquiring users and getting that sales process going and making it a great experience and if you do that really well then why not just own the entire process? The entire sales process?

*[0:22:30]*
**Sid**: That's something that we've considered but moving has a lot more intricacies than just the quote so eight now we are just hyper focused on generating the best quotes possible, that's something that we could possibly do in the future. The second point is we're not acquiring customers today, the moving companies acquire customers themselves so we are a technology that either they're on the website or direct consumers to a rep.

*[0:22:57]*
**Avichal Garg**: Why do you charge more for the AI and less for the people?

*[0:23:01]*
**Sid**: So with the $10 solution the assumption is if you are the moving company you watch the video and provide the quote yourself so there's some human, if you are the moving company you have to hire people to actually watch the video.

*[0:23:15]*
**Avichal Garg**: Oh so you're not hiring the people to do it.

*[0:23:17]*
**Sid**: On the $10, no.

*[0:23:19]*
**Adora Cheung**: Who is actually taking the non AI version?

*[0:23:24]*
**Sid**: Right now our AI is not completely ready yet so that's the product that we are selling right now.

*[0:23:30]*
**Adora Cheung**: I see but why not sell just the AI, I mean that's what you're going to be so why not sell the AI product now, you could still have yourselves in the back-

*[0:23:38]*
**Avichal Garg**: Yeah just fake it.

*[0:23:39]*
**Adora Cheung**: Yeah fake it till you make it you know?

*[0:23:39]*
**Sid**: So that's a good question so two reasons, the first one is we want to train our AI on real world, people's homes. You can imagine when you're moving your house looks nothing like the beautiful catalog pictures-

*[0:23:53]*
**Adora Cheung**: It seems like this is, you need a lot of data and to get a lot of data really quickly you could just provide this blanket solution and all the moving companies think they're getting this thing.

*[0:24:03]*
**Sid**: Yeah, so-

*[0:24:04]*
**Adora Cheung**: And you're providing the same amount of quality either way right?

*[0:24:06]*
**Sid**: Yeah so we are actually hiring teachers that are old sourced whereas our AI is improving their workload that's reducing so that's something that we're doing.

*[0:24:17]*
**Adora Cheung**: So, homes are very different, which is why it's probably such a big problem no one has figured out how to standardize the quoting process. How much data do you think you need before you've gotten something that can just run on its own?

*[0:24:30]*
**Sid**: So we are actively also web scraping for data from Google, Flickr so we have a few million already downloaded to the goal with AI is the accuracy keeps increasing with time and as more consumers use it and we have a feel safe mechanism of humans filling in the gaps in the mean time.

*[0:24:56]*
**Adora Cheung**: What is your biggest challenge right now?

*[0:24:59]*
**Sid**: That's a good question, and that's one thing I think start up school has actually helped us out with so we are going after large interface contracts and it's taking some time because our AI is not ready yet so we are looking at ways of how to deploy a solution while simultaneously being can monetize it as well. In the mean time because of our mentor from start up school we are doing this GPM solution so that we get our product out the door. We did a non-paid pilot so this is a way to get some paying customers, so anything that can reduce the sales process especially as we're going after the enterprise customers will help us accelerate faster as well as I guess we need to clone ourselves to create a product that's much accurate and in a shorter period of time.

*[0:25:52]*
**Adora Cheung**: It's generating leads and then, so what does your pipeline look like? How many companies do you talk to a day?

*[0:26:00]*
**Zack**: Sure so as I mentioned we're targeting initially these larger enterprises because that allows us to scale faster so we found it's pretty easy to get companies in the funnel when you explain what you're doing. It's the end of that after you've shown them the tech, you've shown them the demo and we're ready to sign for a paid pilot that a lot of folks are saying, "This is great, I need it to do everything right now." So there's a bit of a gap between where we are today and where we need to be where we could close them a lot faster, and that's kind of where we're coming in with these creative ideas of how do we monetize what we have today and then work towards that goal.

*[0:26:33]*
**Avichal Garg**: What is that gap exactly? So they want the full AI and just produces a price quote?

*[0:26:37]*
**Zack**: Correct, yeah. Are you going to expand on this?

*[0:26:39]*
**Sid**: Yeah. You can imagine that we're detecting about 40 objects today, so we need to scale that to 150 objects. Because we're using video we need to track these objects across frames, so we understand that this is one chair, even though I'm seeing it from the fifth-second to the fifteenth-second. So we need to identify the size of the object, because that contributes to cost as well. So there are multiple things that we are doing to ... So we are working simultaneously and making progress and all of these-

*[0:27:12]*
**Avichal Garg**: And are they willing to sign LOI's that say, hey if you have this, we would give you $10,000 a month?

*[0:27:17]*
**Sid**: Already signed.

*[0:27:18]*
**Avichal Garg**: I see. And how many of those LOI's do you have?

*[0:27:20]*
**Sid**: So we have more than a half a dozen of LOI's already signed, so we're still working on the contract dollar amount. With a few customers we are in the final stages of figuring out what that amount actually is going to be.

*[0:27:36]*
**Avichal Garg**: And how are you pricing that? For the ones that you do have signed, how have you priced it?

*[0:27:39]*
**Sid**: For the first year we are pitching a flat fee, so a few hundred thousand dollars, where they can use our product as much as they want where we actually work together with them in refining the process of how consumers actually use that technology to get a quote.

*[0:27:59]*
**Avichal Garg**: I see. So the total contract size or each contract is worth a couple hundred thousand?

*[0:28:04]*
**Sid**: So we are looking at signing a maximum of up to three in the first year for a few hundred thousand dollars.

*[0:28:10]*
**Avichal Garg**: I see. So can you just, to Adora's earlier point, can you just hire two people to do this full-time and go get a couple hundred thousand dollars from these guys and say, "hey we've got AI that's as good as a human" because you literally have a human?

*[0:28:21]*
**Sid**: That's what we're doing. I mean that's our goal once we sign this, but they also want more, a turnaround time of a few hours, so that's something that we are working with actually. That's a very good point.

*[0:28:35]*
**Adora Cheung**: What is your turnaround time? I guess you're optimizing for this at this point.

*[0:28:38]*
**Sid**: Yeah. It depends. We can have a turnaround time as less than one hour. It just means that we need to make sure that we have someone on-call 24 hours a day. So we know the NA spits out the analysis, they're able to clean that.

*[0:28:55]*
**Adora Cheung**: You might actually just want to figure out what the labor costs there for now as you're building up this data and then just price accordingly. So it might not be ... So right now you're charging $10 or something, $50 and it might right now due to the labor costs because you don't have all the data and it's not accurate enough, it might be $100 cost to you, so why not just charge something a little bit above that? It will knock out a number of people who won't pay that much, but at least it'll get you going with real customers.

*[0:29:26]*
**Sid**: So with the large enterprise customers we are pitching a flat rate. So with the smaller guys we are pitching the $10 and $50 just to get more data through our pipeline. But maybe that's a good idea.

*[0:29:36]*
**Adora Cheung**: Why are you pitching a flat rate with the big customers?

*[0:29:40]*
**Sid**: Because this is very new to them and we want to make sure that they are incentivized to use it as much as possible. Pitching on a per use fee we feel like maybe-

*[0:29:54]*
**Adora Cheung**: Do they already have estimators? Because you're replacing them in some sense down the road right?

*[0:29:59]*
**Sid**: So I don't think, initially the target is, let's say you have like a five-bedroom or six-bedroom house, they may still want to send an estimate role. But there's a significant, maybe 75% of the cases where they don't really send an estimator. So initially based on our conversations they may start using us for that specific segment of the market before-

*[0:30:20]*
**Adora Cheung**: This may be getting a little bit into the weeds, but one of the advantages of sending an estimator is you're also a sales person and so they close the sale for them. It might be that especially if you're going to a huge house, that could be a lot of profit for them. They wouldn't even want to just send it off somewhere else. So maybe as you also, this is a tool for that estimator right to go faster and they can get to more houses.

*[0:30:42]*
**Sid**: Yeah that's one of the options that we are working with one of these companies.

*[0:30:47]*
**Adora Cheung**: Okay, got it.

*[0:30:48]*
**Avichal Garg**: So what does this become? Suppose you're successful, you get a bunch of contracts, then what happens?

*[0:30:52]*
**Sid**: So again, we started with moving, but we've also found opportunities in other parallel verticals, like painting and home renovations and so on. Where the data that we are collecting and the AI that we're training will help us get to our solution faster. Our goal is solve the problem for one industry and go horizontal to the second industry and so on.

*[0:31:16]*
**Adora Cheung**: It seems like something like painting would be easier.

*[0:31:18]*
**Avichal Garg**: Yeah I was just thinking exactly that.

*[0:31:19]*
**Adora Cheung**: Because it's just like square footage almost.

*[0:31:20]*
**Avichal Garg**: It sounds like so much easier for them to sell.

*[0:31:24]*
**Sid**: It's actually slightly more difficult because if an on-sight estimator comes to estimate your painting areas, whether it's like all these furniture that's blocking the views of the walls and so on. And also getting scale is important in painting, so we need to get to the square feet level. So we looked at it and then we think that the moving is an easier problem to solve actually.

*[0:31:53]*
**Avichal Garg**: Technically speaking.

*[0:31:54]*
**Sid**: Technically speaking.

*[0:31:55]*
**Adora Cheung**: I think this is such a huge business. If you guys can eventually just solve the estimation problem, the pricing problem, you've solved 90% of the headache that all these lead generation, home service lead generation sites.

*[0:32:06]*
**Sid**: We agree.

*[0:32:07]*
**Adora Cheung**: Yeah, so it's like a billion dollar, this is the next Google potentially right? Yeah, congrats. You should apply to YC.

*[0:32:15]*
**Sid**: Yeah, looking forward to that.

*[0:32:17]*
**Avichal Garg**: Good job guys.

*[0:32:18]*
**Zack**: Thank you.

*[0:32:28]*
**Avichal Garg**: Thanks.

*[0:32:28]*
**Adora Cheung**: Hi, Adora, nice to meet you.

*[0:32:29]*
**Avichal Garg**: Hey, Avichal, good to meet you. So tell us what you do.

*[0:32:37]*
**Speaker 9**: Hello. Can you hear me? Yeah. So we are Alma Base, so what we do is we help schools build and engage them in the communities. So currently schools have a problem tracking their alumni once they graduate and alumni experience is very broken. The moment they graduate, they keep getting this giving solicitation emails and nothing much. So with Alma Base what happens is you can create a private alumni network where your alumni can sign up using the universal log ins like Facebook and LinkedIn and then they can engage with each other for mentorships, for job opportunities, or for signing up for the reunions and such things. When those alumni are engaging, the schools would get insights like, all right so how was this particular user engaging, this alumni engaging with our Facebook page, how many times he has liked us, or how many times he has commented, also insights so that they can prioritize their alumni and then they can reach out to the right alumni for different opportunities.

*[0:33:28]*
**Adora Cheung**: Is this for colleges, high schools?

*[0:33:30]*
**Speaker 9**: And schools, yeah K-12, independent schools, and universities.

*[0:33:33]*
**Adora Cheung**: Do they all have the same problems in terms of reaching out to alumni?

*[0:33:37]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah. So universities definitely have a different problem because they are at a different scale, but schools have a different problem. The biggest problem that the schools have is they do not have updated alumni data because the moment they graduate-

*[0:33:48]*
**Adora Cheung**: So it's just a basic, like all they need is currently just a basic CRM and it'd be 100X better than what they have.

*[0:33:55]*
**Speaker 9**: Kind of. Kind of. But the way that they get the data into the CRM is by the social media that's the key value that we provide. So the moment you sign up, we get your profile information from Facebook, education, your employment, your current location. So if someone has moved from like San Francisco to Boston and they update it on Facebook it automatically gets synced here. Currently the way schools are tracking it is by either putting up a Google Form on their alumni tabs on the school website or by asking them to email or doing phone , which is like-

*[0:34:23]*
**Adora Cheung**: So isn't part of the problem just connection to that person? So once just emailing them and they actually seeing the email and then converting that person?

*[0:34:33]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah, but it's quite difficult. Like how many times you have responded to any of your school emails and then once you get the input from the email, then you are going to need to put in some other database and you always need to manually update the database, an Excel spreadsheet or something like that.

*[0:34:46]*
**Adora Cheung**: Which type of customer are you focused on right now? High schools or colleges?

*[0:34:48]*
**Speaker 9**: High schools, like K-12 high schools.

*[0:34:50]*
**Adora Cheung**: Interesting.

*[0:34:51]*
**Speaker 9**: The independent ones.

*[0:34:53]*
**Avichal Garg**: From the end user perspective, why would they want to sign up? They're going to have a Snap Chat and an Instagram, a Facebook, a What's app, a Facebook messenger, a phone, an email address, a Slack, and this?

*[0:35:04]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah I got it. This is something that a lot of people ask me every day. But in startup school, in our group I just posted to say, how many of you want to join a new network of your alumni and why do you want to join? So everyone was like, yeah we want to have the private network because LinkedIn and Facebook are public networks, but they want to just be in the close-

*[0:35:27]*
**Avichal Garg**: Why doesn't the Facebook group just solve this?

*[0:35:29]*
**Speaker 9**: The Facebook group doesn't solve it because you cannot actually link to each other for job opportunities or for mentorships for one thing.

*[0:35:36]*
**Avichal Garg**: What do you mean? Why not?

*[0:35:36]*
**Speaker 9**: Sorry?

*[0:35:37]*
**Avichal Garg**: Why not? Why can't you just message somebody if you're in the same group?

*[0:35:40]*
**Speaker 9**: No, but I mean how many times do you actually get those notifications like, I turn off a lot of my groups and then each of the groups is like seven person these days because Facebook really wants to promote ads or something on the groups, so it's quite difficult in terms of that engagement on Facebook groups.

*[0:35:56]*
**Avichal Garg**: But why wouldn't the same thing ... So if I followed your logic, you basically said, you could theoretically join a group, then people could reach out to you, they can like your stuff, they can post a bunch in the group, and Facebook will notify you because there's stuff happening in the group, that starts to get annoying, so you turn off the notifications.

*[0:36:11]*
**Speaker 9**: Exactly.

*[0:36:12]*
**Avichal Garg**: Why wouldn't the same thing happen for you?

*[0:36:13]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah so here you can actually, I'll setup different notifications. Like when they're signing up, we ask them, how do you want to contribute back to your community, is it by mentorship or is it by providing job sharing opportunities or by giving or volunteering or planning the reunion? So ask those and based on that they can configure notifications and they would be getting a digest based on these settings.

*[0:36:34]*
**Avichal Garg**: I see.

*[0:36:34]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah. So you wouldn't be getting all the common ones. For example, the class of 1990 is having a reunion and you're in the Stanford group and you're from the class of 2000 then you actually wouldn't want to see that right. That's an annoyance for you. It's not relevant for you and the group.

*[0:36:53]*
**Adora Cheung**: How many schools do you have currently?

*[0:36:55]*
**Speaker 9**: To be precise, 94.

*[0:36:56]*
**Adora Cheung**: And how many per school, alumni per school are on your thing?

*[0:37:00]*
**Speaker 9**: So on average it's 5,000 and it goes to like 15,000 depending upon the boarding school or the kind of school it is.

*[0:37:09]*
**Adora Cheung**: 5,000 alumni per school.

*[0:37:10]*
**Speaker 9**: Per school yeah.

*[0:37:10]*
**Adora Cheung**: Are on your site.

*[0:37:11]*
**Avichal Garg**: You have like how many schools?

*[0:37:13]*
**Speaker 9**: Ninety-four.

*[0:37:14]*
**Avichal Garg**: So you have 450,000 people?

*[0:37:15]*
**Speaker 9**: No, we have our own like a million records, like some schools have more and we also have signed up some of the universities and of that, like 25 people have signed up on the platform. Some of them are still have yet to sign up on the platform.

*[0:37:28]*
**Adora Cheung**: And what are they doing when they sign up to the platform?

*[0:37:31]*
**Speaker 9**: So one thing is the admins, like the alumni relations office, they have different tools where they can post content and a weekly digest goes. So they come and they consume this content or they respond to any of the things, like there's a section called "needs". If someone wants any help they can just post there, so they come and they respond to this. This is actually the data where at this point in time or is there any job postings, they just come and apply if they are looking for job opportunities.

*[0:37:55]*
**Avichal Garg**: Yeah. So if I'm the office that's ... Who's actually buying this? Who's making the purchase of this?

*[0:38:01]*
**Speaker 9**: The school is buying it.

*[0:38:03]*
**Avichal Garg**: So who inside the school is making the decision?

*[0:38:05]*
**Speaker 9**: Alumni relations office, not the association, but the alumni relations office. So every school has a development office in which the alumni relations office is a part of, so they buy it.

*[0:38:14]*
**Avichal Garg**: I see. And how are you pricing it for these people?

*[0:38:14]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah we are pricing ... So we have three different plans, but the pro plan is something we just a lot of our features, which is $5,000 per year.

*[0:38:25]*
**Avichal Garg**: Per year.

*[0:38:26]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah.

*[0:38:26]*
**Adora Cheung**: It would seem like one, to get these users it would be right after they graduate. But two, something, I feel like the missing feature here is something along the lines of school spirit. I can't articulate it right now, but this is what's not on ... I'm trying to say is a lot of what you're building is already on Facebook or these other things and people naturally create these groups actually. Maybe it's not the entire school, but it's their friend set. Like I'm in a group of 100 people at my high school I think. But what I ... I don't know. I'm not sure where I'm going to right now, but I think the way to capture these people and the alumni folks, the administrators, can capture some kind of school spirit thing where it gets them back to the other site.

*[0:39:12]*
**Speaker 9**: Exactly. If you look at it, the reason why you do not want to give your contact information is because the school is not providing any value to you at this point of time. But if they could provide some value, hey, there are so many mentors, if you want any mentorship can you just come here and we'll be helping you. Then there's a student aspect there. For example, the graduating class, like in the high schools especially when they're going for their college applications or something, then the counseling offices in the schools they can just match these people and then help them get a better counseling regarding their college. So these kind of small things that they can do at this point of time, which I think is not so structured in Facebook groups or anything of that sort. The key thing here is the alumni office can take control of all of this, like what is the active duty which is happening, which is not possible .

*[0:39:58]*
**Avichal Garg**: What does success look like for the alumni office? Like in a year they have to renew the contract and buy again, how do they decide whether or not to give you another $5,000?

*[0:40:06]*
**Speaker 9**: So I think it's about the number of alumni that sign up and then the kind of enrichment that they get in the data. For example, one of the schools, so they have only like 600 records, but their total alumni is like 8,000 people. So we also have an invite tool where they can invite folks via Facebook and LinkedIn, so now they have 1,800 folks in the first six months.

*[0:40:27]*
**Avichal Garg**: So why do they want those records?

*[0:40:30]*
**Speaker 9**: So again, for giving or for knowing the preferences and engaging them better and providing them more value.

*[0:40:36]*
**Avichal Garg**: It sounds like there's some downstream metric. Let's say I'm the alumni office and I got all 8,000 records in the database and I'm the principal of that school, do I just fire the alumni guy. That person's out of a job now because they got all 8,000 records?

*[0:40:47]*
**Speaker 9**: I think the place where they're going to use it is for example, it's for mentoring, which is a huge value that we are thinking, but even if the alumni office are not really, they do not know what are the key metrics, so we are also trying to help them build those KPIs along the way when they are working with it.

*[0:41:04]*
**Adora Cheung**: It sounds like the answer would be similar along the lines of donations per alumni coming in right.

*[0:41:08]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah that's the end goal. So if you look at a final-

*[0:41:11]*
**Adora Cheung**: So what are the tools ... Then you have to build them these tools right? So you've got all these people in great. Now how are you going to get these people to donate?

*[0:41:19]*
**Speaker 9**: How to donate? So we have a fundraising module where you can put different campaigns, like okay this is the annual campaign, this is a campaign for a particular building, and then you can make donations on some already, this is in honor of my son or pet.

*[0:41:31]*
**Avichal Garg**: So if that's the critical thing, like the alumni person is trying to figure out how to get more donations ultimately, why do all this extra work to try to get ... Like why not go through their existing channels and help them optimize what they're already doing?

*[0:41:42]*
**Speaker 9**: Sure. What we have seen is when they are just doing this sole station for those donations, actually the donation rate has come down. For example, in the schools, it has actually come down when compared to the alumni, 300 users just donating to nonprofits. These days they are just donating to cause and not to the schools or anything of that sort. So what we believe is, the premise or the hypothesis that we have is engaged alumni would eventually turn out to be donors, so that's why all of this. So you need to provide value before and then ask them. Don't just ask them.

*[0:42:18]*
**Avichal Garg**: I see. And is there data from ... This sort of software has been around for a long time. I have to imagine. It's effectively CRM software.

*[0:42:26]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah on the backend yeah.

*[0:42:28]*
**Avichal Garg**: But I get emails all the time from organizations that I've been involved with that try to engage me and have programs. Is there data that says yes if you engage your alumni they will actually donate more?

*[0:42:39]*
**Speaker 9**: Not yet. I mean we have been for 18 months.

*[0:42:41]*
**Avichal Garg**: No, no, from other software. There's mailing lists right, so are people who are responding to mailing lists more likely to donate?

*[0:42:49]*
**Speaker 9**: That's what the schools say at least. We have been ... I asked them, who are your current donors, so they say, yeah these are like alumni who are engaged or who are teaching or who come here for guest lectures or who regularly respond to our emails. But we do not know the exact numbers, but that's what we get a sense of.

*[0:43:06]*
**Avichal Garg**: Interesting.

*[0:43:07]*
**Adora Cheung**: Is there a reason why you started with high school versus colleges? Because it seems like colleges have much bigger budgets for this. In fact they have entire offices for this. And then the alumni have more money to donate.

*[0:43:19]*
**Speaker 9**: Sure. Sure. So is with the schools. Surprisingly, so is with the schools. But the reason why, we initially went behind colleges, but then the sale cycles were really long. There is a lot of donation making process and then the procurement process and some building system in some universities.

*[0:43:33]*
**Adora Cheung**: But if that's where all the money's at.

*[0:43:35]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah we'll eventually go there. We'll eventually go. Like one, several times, so we are just doing.

*[0:43:39]*
**Adora Cheung**: But I think the tools you build for high school alumni administration are much different than the college ones.

*[0:43:46]*
**Speaker 9**: Eventually. Yes, so we are-

*[0:43:47]*
**Adora Cheung**: I think what we're suggesting is-

*[0:43:50]*
**Speaker 9**: Go to just the high schools?

*[0:43:52]*
**Adora Cheung**: Well-

*[0:43:52]*
**Speaker 9**: Universities and not the high schools?

*[0:43:53]*
**Adora Cheung**: We talked to you for 10 minutes, so I wouldn't pivot the entire thing right now, but I would really think hard about the market opportunity between high school and college.

*[0:44:02]*
**Speaker 9**: No. I agree that the market opportunity is huge with universities. Just the pure paperback math says that. But the only thing is, it's a lot more sale cycle and it's just stagnating with growth at this point of time, but with the schools they're eventually two people in an office. If you both agree to buy it, you just buy it. But in a university, you are the alumni relations director, and you are a second director and you both agree, now we need to go to the development director and then you need to go to the VP of advancement, the institutional advancement and then the procurement office.

*[0:44:35]*
**Adora Cheung**: Yeah, but once you figure out that sales price process, I know it's difficult, but once you figure out, it's probably similar in all colleges. Then you just optimize that and get really good at it, and then people will start coming in faster right. But it is a pain to get it setup.

*[0:44:47]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah. So what we have seen is like for example, there are other players in this market. So we have, we are just tracking of what rate they are also closing the higher ed if they are selling the higher ed and we are talking to a few people. So they say it's eventually how much ever, I don't know whether they have really cracked the process, but they have nine to 12 month sales cycles. It's a long relationship building process. They initially need to meet the champion, then they need to echo with them. It's really, really long sales process.

*[0:45:18]*
**Avichal Garg**: No, I mean, that makes sense. That makes a lot of sense. I think the risk really is that you end up, the thing that you want for high school is actually very different than the thing you want for colleges.

*[0:45:31]*
**Speaker 9**: Sure.

*[0:45:31]*
**Avichal Garg**: And so actually you have now built a product for this market that can't go to the more valuable market. You end up in this niche that is great because it was faster to win that niche, but it doesn't translate to the bigger, more valuable niches like the risk that you run with that strategy.

*[0:45:45]*
**Speaker 9**: No, true, but there is a slight overlap in the kind of tools that we are building. So I feel that once we get some insights here and then we also have a couple universities I think eight universities currently using us. So based on those insights, we are keeping a close eye on them, and depending on that, once we build enough success stories with them, like a case study, then we have a much better social group, which might be helpful in optimizing the sales process.

*[0:46:12]*
**Adora Cheung**: You might want to start, I think this is what Avichal was getting at earlier is, the people at the colleges, they already have a system in place, Millingless Marketing campaigns and stuff like that. Maybe you don't initially replace all of it, but maybe talk to a bunch of these people and maybe you can build tools to help them do something. I don't know what it is, but something better. And then start from there. It wouldn't cost as much, but it gets you in the door.

*[0:46:36]*
**Speaker 9**: Sure. Sure. Yeah.

*[0:46:40]*
**Avichal Garg**: Sorry, but the other big thing, everything that you're saying makes a lot of sense in the near term. If you look at, there's this great story it's like the very first banner ad on the internet had like a 73% click through rate or something insane just because nobody had ever seen a banner ad. They were like, "what is that" and everybody clicked on it and obviously people don't click on banner ads anymore. I'm sure when notifications had crazy CTR and they still have actually surprisingly good CTR. So the risk you actually run is by trying to build your own distribution channel that you end up having the same thing happen to you a couple of years from now and then you're in a tough spot. When actually to me, it sounds like you articulated it really well is the crux of what you want to do is help these people raise more money. The channel is just the means to helping them raise the money. Another way to attack it is like, okay well if you want to raise money, what are the 10 things I could build for you that would just raise the money, rather than needing the channel to raise the money, which is just one tactic to get there.

*[0:47:31]*
**Speaker 9**: Sure. So like a pilot, so what I'm doing is I'm volunteering with one of our customers in the Bay Area school who is doing this specific fundraising campaign. So we are building some tools for them to understand that exact problem. What of these tools are required, if at all, we need to just only sell the fundraising aspect. Give it for free and maybe take a cut, which makes the donation making process very easy. So we're volunteering and kind of working and feeling out what is there. We're still in fundraising.

*[0:48:00]*
**Avichal Garg**: Yeah. Maybe to put it a slightly different way. It seems like there are already a lot of channels out there between mail, email, Facebook, LinkedIn, whatever, messengers, text, and building yet another channel creates a lot of product risk for you, but actually just helping them raise the money better through the channels that they're already trying to manage would be a different way to approach it. You might be actually go after a much bigger market.

*[0:48:23]*
**Speaker 9**: Sure. Actually I have, I think that's the biggest challenge that we are facing also. Initially we built these tools for the alumni relations office where in the backend they can do all of this because they are the ones who's making the purchase at the end of the day. So they need to immediately see that instant gratification of improving their work. But getting the alumni to sign up is a big challenge, like you were mentioning. So yeah, that's a big product challenge that we have.

*[0:48:51]*
**Avichal Garg**: Like I could imagine literally, if you just made it easy, some of the places I donate, you click through on the link and you're like, wow I'm trying to give you money and you're making it so hard. I can't donate on my phone. Forms and they don't fill in properly and then they validate improperly from the job descript. I'm trying to give you money, why is this so hard?

*[0:49:08]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah.

*[0:49:08]*
**Avichal Garg**: I can imagine literally you would just, the alumni office would be so happy if their conversion went from 5% to 12%, they would just make more money.

*[0:49:15]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah exactly. Yeah that's what we are trying.

*[0:49:17]*
**Adora Cheung**: Great. Cool. I think that's it.

*[0:49:19]*
**Speaker 9**: Sure.

*[0:49:19]*
**Adora Cheung**: Thanks so much.

*[0:49:19]*
**Avichal Garg**: Thank you. Good job. Yeah sure. If you guys have any questions, open Q&A. Any questions? No?

*[0:49:40]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah I had a question.

*[0:49:42]*
**Avichal Garg**: Yeah ask, go ahead.

*[0:49:42]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah, so one of the challenges we face is for example, we have international founders, there are . So we are not able to get close to our users. So what is the generic advice in terms of in that situation how do you actually get to understand your users better?

*[0:49:56]*
**Avichal Garg**: Why are you not able to get to your users?

*[0:49:59]*
**Speaker 9**: So-

*[0:50:00]*
**Avichal Garg**: You're here right now right?

*[0:50:01]*
**Speaker 9**: Yeah, but after a point of time I need to again travel back and then again come. So we are like switching our roles, like three co-founders, so each of us come at different times and then we stay and then we work with the schools. But that has been an ongoing challenge for us.

*[0:50:17]*
**Adora Cheung**: I think, are you at based, where are you based?

*[0:50:19]*
**Speaker 9**: Here in Mountainview.

*[0:50:21]*
**Adora Cheung**: Mountainview. And who are your users that are elsewhere?

*[0:50:25]*
**Speaker 9**: So there are different schools right. So the schools in the Bay Area.

*[0:50:31]*
**Adora Cheung**: So-

*[0:50:31]*
**Speaker 9**: They're from different states, sorry.

*[0:50:32]*
**Adora Cheung**: Oh I see, okay. Well I mean, I think you should ... The main thing is establishing a relationship with these folks and so sitting down with them for a little bit, for I don't know, a day or a week and get the workflow going is one way to do it. Then obviously you can't be everywhere at once, but I think you can build a lot of product and you don't have to be right next to them.

*[0:50:55]*
**Avichal Garg**: I think there's like two general classes of way to do this. There's a qualitative and there's a quantitative. On the qualitative you can, there's all different scales. You can literally have, there's one-on-one studies that you're doing with users, you can have a forum that you create online, there's user feedback software that will give you a bunch of good qualitative feedback and as people upload something it gives you some signal. I've seen companies use what they would call like a client counsel. What you do is you take like a representative sample of 12-15 people, you bring them in once a quarter, once every six months, you show them new stuff, they're NDA'd, they talk through it, they give you qualitative feedback and it's like a very targeted way to do this all in one sitting. And then there's all the quantitative stuff. So there's all these metrics. Ultimately your KPI's and there's only really four classes of metrics. There's like how many people use your stuff, how deeply do they use your stuff, how good is it at doing the thing that you say it's supposed to do, and how much money do you make? And all of your metrics basically roll into those four. When you're building features you're just mapping against those things and you see whether those numbers move. So between those two you should be able to triangulate whether or not a thing is working.

*[0:51:55]*
**Speaker 9**: Thank you.

*[0:51:58]*
**Avichal Garg**: We have more time? We're out of time.

*[0:52:02]*
**Speaker 1**: I think that's it.

*[0:52:03]*
**Avichal Garg**: That's it. Cool. Thanks guys.
